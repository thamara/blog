<p class="message">
  Hey there! I'm Thamara, a Software Engineer living in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. I love coffee, programming and board games. I talk about things I learned while working on open source projects, or any other topic I'm feeling like. But really, it's mostly tech related. My pronouns are she/her.

**Yeah, I'm a proud owner of a colletion of cute adhesive bandage, which I frequently use on the account of being a bit clumsy**
