  Hey there! I'm Thamara, a Software Engineer living in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. I love coffee, programming and board games. I talk about things I learned while working on open source projects, or any other topic I'm feeling like. But really, it's mostly tech related. My pronouns are she/her.

Feel free to say hi on any place :)
